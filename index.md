# Road Crossing Aid For The Visually Impaired

---

This a report on a project that was developed in a hackathon hosted by [ImplementAI](https://mcgillai.com/implementai-2018). In this report we are going to implement and analyze the AI mechanism part of the project. This report is divided into the following sections:

 1. **Introduction**
 2. **Implementation:** This section contains the preliminary implementations that are taken advantage of in the next section.
 3. **Training:** This section contains our training for the AI agent along with the analysis of our findings.
 4. **Conclusion and Future Work**
 
# 1. Introduction
Visually impaired people make up approximately 19\% of the world's population. That is approxiamtely **one billion and four hundred thirteen million** people worldwide. However, technology and its development often forgets such large portion of population, and their needs. We decided to implement an AI based technique to aid visually impaired cross the road. In this attempt we are tackling zebra crossings. However, we also have solutions for other scenarios, that we will pursue and study on later dates. The mechanism we implemented for this task can be seen in the following figure:
